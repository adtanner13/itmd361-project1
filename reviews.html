        <p><strong><em>House of Leaves</em> - Mark Z. Danielewski</strong></p>
        <p>This is the book I am currently reading, and I am really enjoying it! The story is about a young man, Johnny, who finds hundreds pages of writing about a movie that never existed. The book details these pages with footnotes from Johnny. As the plot of the movie becomes more supernatural, the footnates become less grounded, and Johnny begins to ramble. It is an incredibly engaging postmodern story, and I look forward to finishing it!</p>
