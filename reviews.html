        <h1>Movie, Book, and Song Reviews</h1>

        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p><strong><em>Fergus Crane</em> - Paul Stewart</strong></p>
        <p>Fergus Crane was my favorite childhood story. It follows Fergus, a boy living on an island who is whisked away on an exciting adventure. The book features illustrations by Chris Riddell, who has an incredibly unqiue style. His drawings paired with a relatively mature and engaging story made this book stick in my mind as a child. Even today I remember many of the illustrations and could regonize his style anywhere. This book captivated me in my youth, and I would reccomend it for anyone with children interested in reading.</p>
        <p><strong><em>House of Leaves</em> - Mark Z. Danielewski</strong></p>
        <p>This is the book I am currently reading, and I love it so far! The story is about a young man, Johnny, who finds hundreds pages of writing about a movie that never existed. The book details these pages with footnotes from Johnny. As the plot of the movie becomes more supernatural, the footnates become less grounded, and Johnny begins to ramble. It is an incredibly engaging postmodern story, and I look forward to finishing it!</p>

        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <p><strong><em>The Princess Bride (1987)</em></strong></p>
        <p>This was my favorite movie as a child, and remains that way today. The humor is entertaining for all ages, and the actors are flawless. In addition, many lines are iconic pieces of recent culture, and many people quote it without even realizing. Overall, it is a great movie with undeniable impact.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022)</em></strong></p>
        <p>I watched this movie over the Summer, a year after it was first released. The story is simultaneously emotional and hilarious, and I had to frequently hold myself back from laughing or crying too loud. In addition, it features many practical effects as a result of its lower budget. Many large movie studios are afraid to experiment in the same way that this movie did, and I hope its success inspires more original movies.</p>
